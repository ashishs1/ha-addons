[MeshCentral](https://github.com/Ylianst/MeshCentral) is an open-source computer management web site. With MeshCentral, you can run your own web server to remotely manage and control computers on a local network or anywhere on the internet. Once you get the server started, create device group and download and install an agent on each computer you want to manage. A minute later, the new computer will show up on the web site and you can take control of it. MeshCentral includes full web-based remote desktop, terminal and file management capability.

To start using this add-on, add my repository to your homeassistant instance, and install this add-on. 
The only configuration needed for running this add-on the subdomain you intend to access MeshCentral from (like mesh.example.com).
**NOTE**: This add-on assumes that you have a proxy server (like Nginx Proxy Manager) to forward the exposed port. If not, you will have to configure the MeshCentral HTTPS port to 443.

_Please do open an issue if you find any issues while installing/running the add-on._
